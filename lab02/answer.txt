Q: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

A: These two constructors have the same number and type of parameters (one String), which means they share the same signature and will cause an error. To overload constructors, their signatures must be different. In short, Java doesn't allow us to do this.
